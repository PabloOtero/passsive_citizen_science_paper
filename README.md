# Dataset and methodology used in the manuscript "Challenges of Passive Citizen Science in Ecology within a Shifting Social Media Landscape"
Results (Excel file) and methodology (below) of queries to Web of Science used in the manuscript submitted to Ecological Informatics.


# Methodology
Counts by year of the number of academic articles under the 'passive citizen science' topic (Figure 2a in the manuscript) have been computed following the methodology below:

1. We have logged in the Web of Science through the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas (CSIC) user. This is the URL: https://www.webofscience.com/wos/alldb/basic-search
2. We have performed different queries by keywords, searching in the title, abstract, and indexing; this is known as 'topic' in the WoS. All queries comprise from 2010 to 2024 (both years included). The years represent Published Early Access Year for those items where it is different from the Final Publication Year. The Published Early Access version of the article is considered to be the 'version of record' for Web of Science Core Collection and is used when defining citation baselines for all citation metrics in InCites and Journal Citation Reports. Only 'article' type documents have been taken into account. This refinement excludes book chapters and proceedings, among other types of documents. By using the advanced search tool of the web, we have done the following queries:  
   2.1. The term 'iEcology'.  
   2.2. The terms 'passive citizen science' AND biodiversity.  
   2.3. The terms 'social media' OR 'social network', AND biodiversity.  
   2.4. The terms 'citizen science', 'community science', 'biodiversity' OR 'species', combined with 'Twitter', 'Flickr', 'Instagram', 'Facebook' or 'Youtube'.  
3. Previous queries were combined by using the advanced search tool, eliminating duplicates.
4. From the total of records, we have only taken into account those studies that have used social platforms to gather or retrieve new information about biodiversity or species observation, excluding those that used social networks to promote citizen science, launched surveys (which is more active than our perspective) or are related to awareness activities. We have decided what to include by reading the abstracts. The supervision reduced the list to 497 items.
5. An Excel file is provided with a last column named "REFINED", being True or False, which refers to the inclusion in our final dataset.
